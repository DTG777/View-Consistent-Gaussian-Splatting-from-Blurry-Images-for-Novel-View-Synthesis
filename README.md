# View Consistent Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis

This repository contains the implementation of the method described in the paper "View Consistent Gaussian Splatting from Blurry Images for Novel View Synthesis". The method aims to improve novel view synthesis from blurry images by leveraging view-consistent Gaussian splatting .

## How to Run

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
```shell
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd view-consistent-gaussian-splatting
```
4. Install dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the main script:
```shell
sh script/deblur.sh
```
